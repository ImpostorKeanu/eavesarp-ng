In the context of ARP, **host poisoning**[^stationx] occurs when an [[notes/Attacker|attacker]] poisons a [[notes/ARP Sender|sender's]] ARP cache such that the attacker's MAC address becomes associated with a distinct IP address, whether it's the gateway (see [[notes/Gateway Poisoning|Gateway Poisoning]]) or [[notes/ARP Target|target]] host.

[^stationx]: This resource does a good job of illustrating gateway/host poisoning. https://www.stationx.net/how-to-perform-an-arp-poisoning-attack/
