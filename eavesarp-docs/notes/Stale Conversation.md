A **stale conversation** is a [[notes/Conversation|conversation]] with a [[notes/ARP Target|target]] address for which [[notes/Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]] resolution failed, indicating that:

- the sender has a [[notes/Stale Network Address Configuration|SNAC]] for the target.
- the target is *likely* offline.

>[!TIP]
>Stale conversations are marked with the [[notes/Greek Alphabet Legend#Sigma|sigma]] symbol in the SNAC column of the Eavesarp UI.
