A **stale conversation** is a [[notes/Conversation|conversation]] with a target protocol (IP) address for which ARP resolution failed, indicating that:

- the target is *likely* offline
- the sender has a [[notes/Stale Network Address Configuration|SNAC]] for the target

Stale conversations are marked with the [[notes/Greek Alphabet Legend#Sigma|sigma]] symbol in the SNAC column of the UI.
